# 🌾 MilletVision – Millet Classification Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
**MilletVision** is a deep learning–based web application that classifies different types of millets from an uploaded image.  
The project uses a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model for accurate image classification and provides nutritional information and recipe suggestions for each millet.

This system helps users easily identify millets that look visually similar and promotes healthy eating.

## 🎯 Motivation
Millets are rich in nutrients but are often difficult to identify due to their similar appearance.  
The motivation behind MilletVision is to use **Artificial Intelligence** to automate millet identification and increase awareness about their health benefits.

## ⚙️ System Architecture
1. User uploads a millet image  
2. Image is preprocessed (resize, normalization)  
3. Image is passed to the trained ViT model  
4. Model predicts the millet type  
5. Output displayed:
   - Millet name  
   - Nutritional benefits  
   - Recipe suggestions
